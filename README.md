# Dice-Game.java
A Dice Game made in java using Apache NetBeans IDE 12.6 edition  
configured as a NetBeans ‘Ant’ build


A Java 8 program (as a NetBeans project) to simulate a simple dice game for two players
sitting at the console, i.e., taking turns by sharing the keyboard. The game is a scoring game that requires
five dice. The aim of the game is to be the player with the highest cumulative score after seven rounds of
play. A description of the game follows.

Figure 1: Score table for dice game
The game is played over exactly seven rounds i.e., each player will take seven turns (alternating). For each
turn, a player has up to three throws of the dice. The aim is for the player to produce a selected die number
(mapped to the score table) with as many of the five dice as possible to gain the highest score for that turn.
Each turn challenges the player to make an early choice of category and then go for it. A different category
must be selected for each turn, i.e., all seven categories must be selected over the seven turns. The game is
mainly luck, but with some strategy.
The game progresses as follows:
The first player throws all five dice. After the throw, the player has the following options:
• Set aside one or more of the dice.
• Defer the throw i.e., decide not to select any of the dice and keep all five dice to throw again.
In setting aside one or more dice, the player is required to select a category in the score table to go for. This
must be one of the seven categories that has not already been selected (in an earlier turn) for that player.
Once a choice has been made by the player (for that turn), it cannot be changed. The categories refer to the
six numbers displayed by a die, and a sequence. A number category refers to the number shown by the dice
that have been set aside (i.e., once the number category is selected, the aim is to try to throw as many of the
remaining dice with the selected number to maximise the score). The sequence category refers to all five
dice showing either numbers 1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6. In choosing to defer following the first throw, the player
can re-throw all five dice and make the category selection after the second throw (but obviously that means
the player will then only have two throws to optimise the score against one of the categories). It is, of
course, quite possible (although statistically improbable) that the player throws all five dice with the same
number value in one throw or throws an entire sequence in one throw. In either of these cases, if the player
can select the appropriate category and set aside all five dice, then the program will end the turn after that
3
throw (moving on to the other player). Similarly, if a player manages to set aside all five dice after their
second throw, then the program will end the turn. In other words, for any given turn a player can make up to
a maximum of three throws, but if the player manages to set aside all five dice after just one or two throws
then the turn ends for that player. It is also possible for a player to defer twice and essentially gamble on
their final throw for that turn. However, the player must then select a category for that throw. Towards the
final stages of the game, it is possible that the player has only a couple of categories not yet completed in
the score table and the turn has resulted in no dice that match any of the remaining categories, but they still
must select a category (and in this case would score zero for that category).
After each turn the program should display the updated score table.
After the first player’s turn has finished, the next player takes their turn (in the same way). The game
comprises both players taking exactly seven turns. The winner is the player with the highest cumulative
score at the end of the game.
Scoring
Scoring is very simple for this dice game. For each of the number categories, a player will score the category
number multiplied by the total number of dice set aside to match that category. E.g., if the player selects
fives as the category (say after the first throw in which they set aside a couple of dice showing five), and at
the end of the turn had three dice showing five, then they would score 15 for that category (and 15 should
be inserted into the score table). If a player successfully manages to throw a sequence (1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-
6) then they score 20 points for that turn (if they have selected that category of course).
